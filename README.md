# **Project Setup**

### Install dependencies for frontend and backend separately
**Tip:** To efficiently install dependencies for both frontend and backend simultaneously, use split terminals.

Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```


### Environment Variables
**Backend**
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
- Add the following variables with appropriate values
```bash
# Database connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb://....................../your-database-name"

# Frontend URL (adjust if needed)
ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"


# Token and cookie expiration settings
LOGIN_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="8h"  

# Secret key for jwt security
SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"

**Frontend**
- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory
- Add the following variable:
```bash
# Backend URL (adjust if needed)
REACT_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" 
```

**Important**
- Replace all placeholders (e.g., your_database_name) with your actual values.
- Exclude the `.env` file from version control to protect sensitive information.

### Login with demo account (Optional)
- After successfully seeding the database, you can now explore the application's functionalities using pre-populated sample data.
- here are the `login credentials`
```bash
  email: demo@gmail.com
  pass: helloWorld@123
```
### Accessing the Application
